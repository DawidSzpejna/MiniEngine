### MiniEngine
This is a graphic project at my university. The project was to include:
- moving object (shifts and rotations)
- some static objects
- vibration of a moving object (can be turned on/off)
- four cameras: free camera, static camera, tracking camera and TPP
- Phong lighting
- 2 spotlights that can be controlled
- fog
- day/night
- lightl intensity
- deferred shading

Above requirements are a core of my system (that is why it is the first 
commit in this repository) which is built in ECS architectural pattern.
